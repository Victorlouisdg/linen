# Linen

For visualizations see [scripts/blender](scripts/blender/).

To learn Linen, see the [notebooks](notebooks/).

## Installation
If you don't want to make Blender visualizations, you can clone and install Linen with pip:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Victorlouisdg/linen.git
cd linen
pip install -e linen
```

Else, follow the [airo-blender installation](https://github.com/airo-ugent/airo-blender) first and also install the [urdf-workshop package](https://github.com/Victorlouisdg/urdf-workshop).
